# GitHub Technical Exercise

For your technical exercise, you'll be contributing to a Food Truck directory
application called GitGrub. There are three exercises, each asking you to build
a part of GitGrub's API. You'll be guided through the exercises with a rake
task, which will present instructions and ensure all tests pass before you move
on to the next round.

Get as far as you can, but don't panic if you don't finish all three exercises.
It's better to complete two of them well than to rush through all three. In the
end, you'll push your work up to a branch and open a pull request, which will
be reviewed by GitHub engineers. Please write the pull request as you would in
your normal course of work on a team.

## Prerequisites
